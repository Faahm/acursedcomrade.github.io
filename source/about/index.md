# comrade@internet > whoami

Hey there! I'm Loshana Aloka (he/him, aka aCursedComrade), an IT student from Sri Lanka. I'm generally interested in all things cyber but my goal is to specialize in system administration and red team security operations. I love to tinker around with networking and systems related stuff and love to share my experience I gain from that as well.

> I'm [open for any junior or internship opportunities](https://read.cv/acursedcomrade) at the moment. I'm mainly looking for a position in security/network operations or system administration. I appreciate having a supportive employer that can help a student like me to keep learning and gain a foothold in the field.
